jQuery.dots
---

A simple plugin to be used for providing the user a feedback about an ongoing background operation, by using the classical 3 dots "..."

# Usage #

To start, simply create some element where you'd want to use the dots plugin. For instance

    <h2 class="loading">Loading</h2>

Then invoke the plugin like

    $(".loading").dots();

This will automatically append the dots and animate them accordingly.
